      "me": "The Alliance is a consolidated pool consisting of multiple pool owners who have unsufficient stake in their own pools to produce blocks in each epoch. The owner rewards of the Alliance are distributed to its owners and are used to cover the costs of running the individual pools of the participating operators. With this the Alliance supports the decentralization of Cardano. Next to that the Alliance enables these pool operators to get sufficient stake to anchor their pools. Last but not least the Alliance aims to deliver high ROI for its delegators. Support decentralization, the operators and yourself by delegating to the Alliance.",
