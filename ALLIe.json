      "me": "We are the Alliance Stake Pool. We are a group of small Cardano Stake Pool Operators who decided to collaborate to consolidate our own small stake pools by joining our forces. Each of us pledged 10K ADA to the Alliance pool and together we strive to collect enough pledge and stake so we can start minting blocks. The pool rewards are then distributed to the individual stake pools giving them a chance to grow and survive. Besides members the Alliance pool also welcomes sponsors. These are pools, with enough stake to produce blocks, that are willing to pledge 10K ADA but do not expect any rewards in return. By doing this, they are actively helping decentralize the Cardano ecosystem. Of course, we also welcome delegators who are looking for a stake pool with special emphasis on supporting the Cardano ecosystem. The Alliance pool and itâ€™s relay nodes run on premium bare metal servers with 24/7 uptime. Security is very important to us. We value your ADA.",
